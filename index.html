        <h1> Resume</h1>
    <p> I come from a small town called Cahokia Il. I have never done any coding<br>
        before in my life and most of my jobs in my life have not involved technology.<br>
        I currently work for American Express as an Account Exe, I have been in this position<br>
        for almost two years. I became interested in computer coding after I helped<br>
        my sister with her Master's in Nursing.</p>

    <p> I recently took my first cruise this spring to multiple carribean islands.<br>
        I came into contact with people from all walks of life and colors. I<br>
        was able to relax take my mind off work and finances for a week. I treated<br>
        my mom to a trip as well. She came with me on my trip all expenses paid.<br>
        I took my mom with me just to show her my appreciation to her for being my mom.</p>
